This `context.md` records the manual work you (the developer) wrote in this repository and provides a concise description of what the project is about and how to run it.

## What is this project about?

OSINT Arena is a competitive Open-Source INTelligence (OSINT) learning and challenge platform. It lets users solve OSINT-style puzzles and challenges to earn ELO points, badges, and certifications. The platform supports:

- Single challenges and multi-question contests (time-limited)
- Leaderboards: global, weekly, and monthly rankings
- User profiles with stats, streaks, badges, and certifications
- Admin panel to manage challenges, contests, and users
- Anti-cheat detection for suspicious submission patterns
- Email notifications and broadcast capability (SendGrid wrapper)

Tech stack
- Frontend: React 18 + Vite (client-side app in `frontend/`)
- Backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage) and Cloud Functions (`functions/`)
- Email: SendGrid (via a small wrapper in `functions/src/lib/sendgrid.js`)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflows for deploying hosting and functions (`.github/workflows/`)

Project layout (top-level)
- `frontend/` — React app source, pages, components, hooks, services
- `functions/` — Firebase Cloud Functions and server-side logic
- `firestore.rules`, `firestore.indexes.json`, `storage.rules` — Firebase config
- `firebase.json`, `.firebaserc`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`

## How to run locally (developer quick start)

Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Functions (requires Firebase CLI and credentials)

```bash
cd functions
npm install
# set environment variables (SENDGRID_API_KEY, etc.) or use local emulator
# to deploy functions:
# firebase deploy --only functions
```

Environment
- Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env` and add your Firebase credentials and API URL.
- Add `SENDGRID_API_KEY` and `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` to `functions/.env` when running functions that send email.

## Notes / Next steps

- This file is a snapshot. Update it when you add or heavily modify files so the record stays accurate.
- If you want, I can generate a checklist of remaining TODOs (tests, CI secrets, production env, more robust anti-cheat rules).

If you want me to include diffs or paste the current contents of any file into this document, tell me which ones and I'll append them.
